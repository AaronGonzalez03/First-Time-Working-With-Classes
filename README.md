# First-Time-Working-With-Classes
This is my first time working and learning in a practical way about classes. For my examples, I have used Berserk characters to feel more orientated and comfortable at the working time.

## 🎮 My First Classes

This folder contains my learning progression with Python classes:

- **V1 (Basic)**: First approach to class attributes and instance attributes
- **V2 (First Methods)**: Attempt to separate attributes and methods (with errors for learning)
- **V3 (Corrected)**: Fixed version with proper method implementation
- **V4 (Final)**: Complete implementation with all methods working correctly

### Features Implemented:
- Character attributes (name, age, weapon, affiliation, health, stamina, damage)
- Methods: run, talk, defend, attack
- State management (alive/dead, stamina consumption)

## 🎲 Mini Game

Interactive character creation system where users can:
- Choose their character's name and age
- Select warrior type (Swordsman, Archer, Mage, Real Fighter)
- Pick appropriate weapons based on class
- View character statistics

### How to Run:
python3 name_of_file.py

## 🚀 What I Learned

- Class and instance attributes
- The `__init__` method for initialization
- Creating and using methods
- Conditional logic within classes
- State management
- Input validation
- Error handling and debugging
